 Fingerprinting is basically to identify a signal based on a short sample for it which usually has its intrinsic features and thus these intrinsic features can be used to identify the different varieties or flavors of the signal. Several applications can be directly spotted for such technique. For example:
 * Music industry: Identify a song, a singer voice, a tune.
 * Medical diagnosis: identify arrhythmia types in ECG signals.

This application used to recognize songs, lyrics, and music using a *database* which contains the components of each song (MFCC component, Melspectrogram component, Chroma Stft component) in a spectrogram form.

- Pick either one song, or two songs and mix between them (The slider percentage applies to the first song while the second songs take 100-Percentage)
- Best matcjes of selected files would appear in the table arranged descendingly.
